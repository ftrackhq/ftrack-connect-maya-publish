At the moment there are a limited set of publish actions to choose from:

*   Camera
*   Geometry
*   Scene

What shows up in the :term:`publish dialog` depends on what you select here. In
:ref:`developing` we will learn more about how to add new publish actions.

Publishing content and settings
===============================

When you have decided to what type of content you want to publish it is time
to choose what you want to publish. From the list on the left side of the
dialog you can pick between different items in the scene. A
:guilabel:`Scene selection` button lets you select based on scene selection.

To the right there is a list of settings for your publish. Make sure to create
an asset or select an existing asset to publish a new version of.

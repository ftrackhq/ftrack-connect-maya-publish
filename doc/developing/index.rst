.. note::

    This article is working in progress and the goal is to cover all aspects of
    developing and extending pipeline tools in ftrack.

    At the moment the documentation is mostly focused on publishing using
    :term:`pyblish` since the bundled :term:`asset plugins <asset plugin>` are
    making use of it. However, :term:`pyblish` is not a requirement when
    extending the pipeline tools with your own :term:`asset plugin`.
